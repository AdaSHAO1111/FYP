## Proposed AI/ML Solutions to Implement

### 1. Traditional Signal Processing with Kalman Filter

A baseline approach using Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for sensor fusion between gyroscope and compass data. The EKF would:
- [ ] Predict heading based on gyroscope data
- [ ] Update predictions when compass data is available
- [ ] Adjust weights based on reliability of each sensor
- [ ] Incorporate quasi-static period detection for recalibration

### 2. LSTM-Based Sensor Fusion

A deep learning approach using LSTM networks to learn temporal patterns in the sensor data:
- [ ] Process sequences of gyroscope and compass readings
- [ ] Include additional features like step count, floor information
- [ ] Output heading estimation that accounts for sensor biases and drift
- [ ] Automatically learn optimal fusion strategy from training data

### 3. Multi-Modal Transformer for Context-Aware Navigation

A transformer-based approach that incorporates multiple data sources:
- [ ] Process sensor data along with environmental features
- [ ] Use self-attention to focus on the most reliable sensor inputs
- [ ] Include positional encodings to understand the trajectory context
- [ ] Leverage transfer learning from pre-trained models

### 4. Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Parameter Tuning

A RL approach to dynamically adjust the quasi-static detection parameters:
- [ ] Use an agent to adjust window size and stability threshold in real-time
- [ ] Define rewards based on heading estimation accuracy
- [ ] Implement exploration-exploitation strategy for parameter space
- [ ] Train in simulation before deploying to real-world

### 5. Ensemble Approach with Adaptive Weighting

A meta-approach that combines multiple heading estimation methods:
- [ ] Run multiple algorithms in parallel (Kalman, LSTM, etc.)
- [ ] Dynamically weight their outputs based on context and performance
- [ ] Use a meta-learner to optimize the weighting strategy
- [ ] Implement online learning to adapt weights in real-time

Each approach will be evaluated on heading accuracy, position error, and computational efficiency to determine the most effective solution for indoor navigation.
