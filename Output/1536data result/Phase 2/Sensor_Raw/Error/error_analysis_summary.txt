POSITIONING ERROR ANALYSIS SUMMARY
=====================================

KEY FINDINGS:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Method   | Average Error | Min Error | Max Error | Standard Deviation  |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Gyro     | 5.45 m        | 0.00 m    | 7.94 m    | 2.23 m             |
| Compass  | 18.27 m       | 0.00 m    | 33.61 m   | 8.49 m             |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

VISUAL ANALYSIS:
===============

1. DISTANCE ERROR PLOT
   - Gyro errors are consistently lower than Compass errors
   - Compass errors increase more rapidly with distance
   - Gyro errors stabilize around 6-7 meters even at longer distances

2. ERROR DISTRIBUTION (ECDF PLOT)
   - Gyro errors are more tightly distributed in the lower range
   - About 80% of Gyro errors are below 7.4 meters
   - Compass errors have a much wider distribution
   - Most Compass errors are above 9.8 meters

3. ERROR RANGE COMPARISON (BOX PLOT)
   - Gyro has a much narrower error range
   - Compass errors are not only higher but more variable
   - The median of Gyro errors (~5.9m) is much lower than Compass (~21.4m)

CONCLUSION:
===========
Gyroscope-based positioning significantly outperforms compass-based positioning:

1. Gyro errors are 70% lower on average
2. Gyro errors show less variability and more consistency
3. Gyro positioning maintains better accuracy over longer distances

This analysis confirms that gyroscope-based positioning is the more reliable
method for indoor positioning in this scenario, particularly when walking
longer distances.
