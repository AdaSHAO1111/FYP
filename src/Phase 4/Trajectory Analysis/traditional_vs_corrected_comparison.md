# Traditional vs. Corrected Trajectory Comparison

## Overview

This document compares the traditional gyro-based position estimation with our corrected position approach that uses improved heading values. The traditional approach directly uses the positions from the gyro sensor integration, while our corrected approach applies heading corrections before calculating positions.

## Data Sources

1. **Traditional Gyro Positions**: Raw positions from direct integration of gyroscope data (`traditional_gyro_positions.csv`)
2. **Corrected Positions**: Positions calculated using our corrected heading values
3. **Ground Truth Positions**: Reference positions used for evaluation

## Results Summary

| GT1   | 1.24              | 0.74            | -40.44% |
| GT2   | 0.96              | 9.39            | +880.97% |
| GT3   | 4.58              | 1.35            | -70.60% |
| GT4   | 3.16              | 1.74            | -44.77% |
| GT5   | 4.67              | 0.78            | -83.28% |
| GT6   | 2.58              | 7.48            | +190.49% |
| GT7   | 6.00              | 2.33            | -61.20% |

### Overall Performance Metrics

## Analysis

### Point-by-Point Analysis

1. **GT1**: The corrected approach shows a significant improvement (40.44% error reduction) compared to the traditional approach. This suggests that heading correction effectively improved positioning at this point.

2. **GT2**: This point shows dramatic degradation (880.97% increase in error). The corrected trajectory deviates significantly from the ground truth at this location. This could be due to:
   - Overcorrection of heading in this segment
   - Cumulative errors in the step size estimation
   - Differences in scaling or alignment between the two approaches

3. **GT3 & GT4**: Substantial improvements (70.60% and 44.77%) indicate that heading correction was highly effective in these segments of the trajectory.

4. **GT5**: The most significant improvement (83.28%) occurs at this point, showing that our correction method works exceptionally well in this segment.

5. **GT6**: Another point of significant degradation (190.49%), suggesting that heading correction may not be beneficial in all segments of the trajectory.

6. **GT7**: Substantial improvement (61.20%), indicating that heading correction recovers accuracy well towards the end of the trajectory.

### Performance Patterns

1. **Mixed Results Across Points**: While the corrected method shows dramatic improvements at most points (5 out of 7), it performs significantly worse at two points (GT2 and GT6). This suggests that:
   - Heading correction is highly effective in certain segments
   - Some segments may require different correction approaches
   - There might be specific movement patterns (like sharp turns) where the correction is less effective

2. **Slightly Worse Overall Average**: Despite improvements at most points, the overall average error is slightly higher for the corrected approach (3.40 vs. 3.31, a 2.68% increase). This is because the degradations at points GT2 and GT6 are quite substantial in magnitude.

3. **High Variance in Performance**: The corrected approach shows much higher variance in performance across different ground truth points compared to the traditional approach.

## Visual Comparison

The trajectory visualizations show several key differences:

1. **Path Coherence**: The corrected trajectory follows the general shape of the ground truth path more closely at most segments.

2. **Turning Points**: The corrected method handles some turning points better, maintaining closer proximity to ground truth positions.

3. **Problematic Segments**: There are clear divergences at segments near GT2 and GT6, where the corrected path deviates from the ground truth more than the traditional path.

4. **Overall Structure**: The corrected trajectory better preserves the overall structure of the ground truth path, despite local deviations at certain points.

## Insights and Recommendations

1. **Segment-Specific Correction**: The widely varying performance across different segments suggests that a one-size-fits-all correction approach is suboptimal. Future improvements could include:
   - Adaptive correction factors based on movement patterns
   - Segment-specific calibration of step size
   - Different correction approaches for different types of movement (straight-line vs. turning)

2. **Hybrid Approach Potential**: A hybrid approach that selectively applies heading correction based on segment characteristics could potentially outperform either method alone.

3. **GT2 and GT6 Investigation**: The specific segments around GT2 and GT6 should be investigated further to understand why the corrected approach performs poorly in these areas.

4. **Step Size Calibration**: The step size calibration is critical for accurate position estimation. Improving this aspect could further enhance the corrected approach.

5. **Scale Factor Consideration**: The need to apply scaling factors indicates scaling inconsistencies between the data sources. A more unified approach to scaling could improve results.

## Conclusion

While the traditional gyro position data shows slightly better average performance across all ground truth points, our corrected approach demonstrates superior accuracy at most individual points. The significant improvements at 5 out of 7 ground truth points (with reductions in error of up to 83.28%) suggest that heading correction is a promising approach for improving position estimation.

The challenges at specific points (GT2 and GT6) highlight the need for more adaptive and context-aware correction methods. Future work should focus on understanding why these specific segments present challenges and developing targeted solutions to address them.

Overall, this comparison demonstrates both the potential and limitations of heading-based correction for position estimation in indoor navigation systems.
