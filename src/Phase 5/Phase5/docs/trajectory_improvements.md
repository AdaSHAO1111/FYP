# Trajectory Improvement Analysis - Addressing QS Filtering and Turn Detection Issues

## Problem Analysis

After analyzing the trajectory comparison results from the original implementation, we identified several key issues that were affecting the accuracy of the heading correction and position estimation:

1. **False QS (Quasi-Static) Field Detection**: After GT5, the system was incorrectly identifying a QS field segment, which caused the heading to be adjusted inappropriately. This resulted in trajectory distortion in that region.

2. **Missed Turn Detection**: A significant turn near GT1 was not being properly detected and handled, leading to inaccuracies in the trajectory construction.

3. **Heading Correction Around Turns**: The existing correction strategy did not properly handle the unique requirements of turns versus straight-line segments.

## Solution Approach

To address these issues, we implemented a three-phase improvement strategy:

### 1. Enhanced QS Field Filtering

We developed a more sophisticated validation method for QS segments to filter out false positives:

- **Cross-validation with Gyro Data**: For each QS segment, we examine the concurrent gyro behavior to verify if the segment is truly a stable heading region.
- **Heading Variance Analysis**: We compute the circular variance of headings during each QS segment to detect instability.
- **Turn Rate Checking**: We verify that the turn rate during the QS segment is below a threshold.
- **Overlap Detection**: We check whether the QS segment overlaps with detected turns, which would invalidate its use as a correction point.

### 2. Improved Turn Detection

We enhanced the turn detection algorithm to better identify and characterize turning behavior:

- **Full Turn Intervals**: Instead of just marking individual points of high angular velocity, we now identify complete turn intervals (start to end).
- **Missed Turn Recovery**: We explicitly search for turn segments that don't have nearby correction points and add them to the correction point set.
- **Turn Characterization**: Each turn is analyzed for its duration, angle change, and turn rate to better inform the correction process.

### 3. Refined Heading Correction Strategy

We implemented a context-aware correction strategy that handles different types of movement differently:

- **Turn-Specific Fade**: For turns, we apply a cosine-based fade function that preserves the turn shape while adjusting its alignment.
- **Differential Correction for Straight Segments**: For straight movement, we preserve the relative changes in heading while correcting the absolute orientation.
- **Smoother Transitions**: Improved interpolation between correction points using circular statistics to avoid sudden jumps in heading.

## Implementation Details

The implementation is divided into three new scripts:

1. **`enhanced_qs_filtering.py`**: Implements the improved QS validation and turn detection algorithms, producing a list of validated correction points.

2. **`improved_heading_correction.py`**: Uses the enhanced correction points to apply a more sophisticated heading correction algorithm with context-aware correction strategies.

3. **`improved_position_correction.py`**: Generates position estimates using the improved heading data and compares with the traditional approach.

## Results

### QS Filtering Improvement

- **Original QS Segments**: Many QS segments were being detected without validation
- **Filtered QS Segments**: Only stable, non-turning segments are now used for heading reference
- **False QS Rejection**: The problematic QS segment after GT5 has been successfully filtered out

### Turn Detection Improvement

- **Original Turn Detection**: Only identified points with high angular velocity
- **Enhanced Turn Detection**: Identifies full turn intervals and missed turns
- **Turn near GT1**: Successfully detected and incorporated into the correction process

### Trajectory Accuracy

The improvements result in:

- **Better Path Structure**: The trajectory now follows the ground truth path more faithfully, especially at turns
- **Reduced Position Error**: Lower average error at ground truth points
- **Improved Performance at Problem Areas**: Specific improvements at GT1 and the segment after GT5

## Visual Comparisons

The enhanced implementation generates several visualization files:

- `enhanced_qs_validation.png`: Shows the validated and rejected QS segments
- `improved_heading_correction_plot.png`: Compares original, previous correction, and improved heading correction
- `improved_trajectory_comparison.png`: Compares traditional and improved trajectories against ground truth
- `improved_error_comparison_chart.png`: Bar chart comparing errors at ground truth points

## Conclusion

By addressing the specific issues in QS field validation and turn detection, we have significantly improved the trajectory accuracy. The context-aware correction strategy better preserves the natural movement patterns while aligning with ground truth reference points. These improvements demonstrate the importance of movement context in heading correction for dead reckoning systems.
